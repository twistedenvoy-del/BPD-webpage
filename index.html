        <h2>Symptoms of BPD in Men</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">Symptoms in men are often externalized leading to other diagnosed disorders due to societal expectations.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Emotional Instability</h3>
                <p>Men with BPD suffer from emotional Instability just as women. Often though they externalize it leading to diagnosis of anti-social behaviour, anger issues, or ptsd.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Impulsivity and risk taking</h3>
                <p>Often men with BPD take risks. Be it fast driving, gambling, or substance abuse they use them to cope.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Interpersonal Difficulties</h3>
                <p>Men suffer from these Difficulties as well. Often with the externalization of their emotions they are seen as having narcissistic personality traits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Cognitive Distortions</h3>
                <p>Often do they see people as either all good or all bad, they are paranoid that people dislike them or are talking about them behind their back even when it is obviously false.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Dissociation</h3>
                <p>Because of societal expectations men tend to suffer silently with dissociation. Emotional blunting or feeling numb even when surrounded by loved ones.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Chronic emptiness</h3>
                <p>Because of these expectations men tend not to get treatmeant they need. They tend to always feel as though something is missing or there is something wrong with them that needs fixed.</p>
